## Why G2

G2 is my personal fork of [NanoClaw](https://github.com/qwibitai/nanoclaw). Same philosophy — a personal Claude assistant you can actually understand — but tailored to my exact needs.

One process. Composable modules with clean interfaces. Agents run in actual Linux containers with filesystem isolation, not behind permission checks.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone git@github.com:v-gaurav/G2.git
cd G2
claude
```

Then run `/setup`. Claude Code handles everything: dependencies, authentication, container setup, service configuration.

## Philosophy

**Small enough to understand.** One process, composable modules with clean interfaces. No microservices, no message queues. Have Claude Code walk you through it.

**Secure by isolation.** Agents run in Linux containers (Apple Container on macOS, or Docker). They can only see what's explicitly mounted. Bash access is safe because commands run inside the container, not on your host.

**Built for one user.** This isn't a framework. It's working software that fits my exact needs. You fork it and have Claude Code make it match your exact needs.

**Customization = code changes.** No configuration sprawl. Want different behavior? Modify the code. The codebase is small enough that this is safe.

**AI-native.** No installation wizard; Claude Code guides setup. No monitoring dashboard; ask Claude what's happening. No debugging tools; describe the problem, Claude fixes it.

**Skills over features.** Contributors shouldn't add features (e.g. support for Telegram) to the codebase. Instead, they contribute [claude code skills](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills) like `/add-telegram` that transform your fork. You end up with clean code that does exactly what you need.

**Best harness, best model.** This runs on Claude Agent SDK, which means you're running Claude Code directly. The harness matters. A bad harness makes even smart models seem dumb, a good harness gives them superpowers. Claude Code is (IMO) the best harness available.

## What It Supports

- **WhatsApp I/O** - Message Claude from your phone
- **Isolated group context** - Each group has its own `CLAUDE.md` memory, isolated filesystem, and runs in its own container sandbox with only that filesystem mounted
- **Main channel** - Your private channel (self-chat) for admin control; every other group is completely isolated
- **Scheduled tasks** - Recurring jobs that run Claude and can message you back
- **Web access** - Search and fetch content
- **Container isolation** - Agents sandboxed in Apple Container (macOS) or Docker (macOS/Linux)
- **Agent Swarms** - Spin up teams of specialized agents that collaborate on complex tasks (first personal AI assistant to support this)
- **Optional integrations** - Add Gmail (`/add-gmail`) and more via skills

## Usage

Talk to your assistant with the trigger word (default: `@G2`):

```
@G2 send an overview of the sales pipeline every weekday morning at 9am (has access to my Obsidian vault folder)
@G2 review the git history for the past week each Friday and update the README if there's drift
@G2 every Monday at 8am, compile news on AI developments from Hacker News and TechCrunch and message me a briefing
```

From the main channel (your self-chat), you can manage groups and tasks:
```
@G2 list all scheduled tasks across groups
@G2 pause the Monday briefing task
@G2 join the Family Chat group
```

## Customizing

There are no configuration files to learn. Just tell Claude Code what you want:

- "Change the trigger word to @Bob"
- "Remember in the future to make responses shorter and more direct"
- "Add a custom greeting when I say good morning"
- "Store conversation summaries weekly"

Or run `/customize` for guided changes.

The codebase is small enough that Claude can safely modify it.

## Skills System CLI (Experimental)

The new deterministic skills-system primitives are available as local commands:

```bash
npm run skills:init -- --core-version 0.5.0 --base-source .
npm run skills:apply -- --skill whatsapp --version 1.2.0 --files-modified src/server.ts
npm run skills:update-preview
npm run skills:update-stage -- --target-core-version 0.6.0 --base-source /path/to/new/core
npm run skills:update-commit
# or: npm run skills:update-rollback
```

These commands operate on `.g2/state.yaml`, `.g2/state.next.yaml`, `.g2/base/`, `.g2/base.next/`, and `.g2/backup/`.

## Contributing

**Don't add features. Add skills.**

If you want to add Telegram support, don't create a PR that adds Telegram alongside WhatsApp. Instead, contribute a skill file (`.claude/skills/add-telegram/SKILL.md`) that teaches Claude Code how to transform a G2 installation to use Telegram.

Users then run `/add-telegram` on their fork and get clean code that does exactly what they need, not a bloated system trying to support every use case.

### RFS (Request for Skills)

Skills we'd love to see:

**Communication Channels**
- `/add-telegram` - Add Telegram as channel. Should give the user option to replace WhatsApp or add as additional channel. Also should be possible to add it as a control channel (where it can trigger actions) or just a channel that can be used in actions triggered elsewhere
- `/add-slack` - Add Slack
- `/add-discord` - Add Discord

**Platform Support**
- `/setup-windows` - Windows via WSL2 + Docker

**Session Management**
- `/add-clear` - Add a `/clear` command that compacts the conversation (summarizes context while preserving critical information in the same session). Requires figuring out how to trigger compaction programmatically via the Claude Agent SDK.

## Requirements

- macOS or Linux
- Node.js 20+
- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/download)
- [Apple Container](https://github.com/apple/container) (macOS) or [Docker](https://docker.com/products/docker-desktop) (macOS/Linux)

## Architecture

```
WhatsApp (baileys) --> SQLite --> Polling loop --> Container (Claude Agent SDK) --> Response
```

Single Node.js process. Agents execute in isolated Linux containers with mounted directories. Per-group message queue with concurrency control. IPC via filesystem.

Key files:
- `src/index.ts` - Entry point: channel setup, `main()` bootstrap
- `src/app.ts` - App class: composes services, wires subsystems
- `src/messaging/MessagePoller.ts` - Message polling, cursor management, trigger checking
- `src/execution/AgentExecutor.ts` - Container execution, session tracking, snapshot writing
- `src/messaging/whatsapp/WhatsAppChannel.ts` - WhatsApp connection, auth, send/receive
- `src/messaging/ChannelRegistry.ts` - Registry pattern for multiple channels
- `src/execution/ContainerRunner.ts` - Spawns streaming agent containers
- `src/execution/ContainerRuntime.ts` - Docker runtime abstraction and `IContainerRuntime` interface
- `src/ipc/IpcWatcher.ts` - IPC watcher; `src/ipc/handlers/` - Consolidated IPC command handlers
- `src/execution/ExecutionQueue.ts` - Per-group queue with global concurrency limit
- `src/scheduling/TaskScheduler.ts` - Runs scheduled tasks
- `src/sessions/SessionManager.ts` - Claude Agent SDK session management
- `src/messaging/MessageFormatter.ts` - Message format transforms (XML, internal tags)
- `src/groups/Authorization.ts` - Fine-grained IPC auth
- `src/execution/MountSecurity.ts` - Mount allowlist validation
- `src/infrastructure/Database.ts` - Schema, migrations, DB init
- `groups/*/CLAUDE.md` - Per-group memory

## FAQ

**Why WhatsApp and not Telegram/Signal/etc?**

Because I use WhatsApp. Fork it and run a skill to change it. That's the whole point.

**Why Docker?**

Docker provides cross-platform support (macOS and Linux) and a mature ecosystem. On macOS, you can optionally switch to Apple Container via `/convert-to-apple-container` for a lighter-weight native runtime.

**Can I run this on Linux?**

Yes. Docker is the default runtime and works on both macOS and Linux. Just run `/setup`.

**Is this secure?**

Agents run in containers, not behind application-level permission checks. They can only access explicitly mounted directories. You should still review what you're running, but the codebase is small enough that you actually can. See [docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md) for the full security model.

**Why no configuration files?**

We don't want configuration sprawl. Every user should customize it to so that the code matches exactly what they want rather than configuring a generic system. If you like having config files, tell Claude to add them.

**How do I debug issues?**

Ask Claude Code. "Why isn't the scheduler running?" "What's in the recent logs?" "Why did this message not get a response?" That's the AI-native approach.

**Why isn't the setup working for me?**

I don't know. Run `claude`, then run `/debug`. If claude finds an issue that is likely affecting other users, open a PR to modify the setup SKILL.md.

**What changes will be accepted into the codebase?**

Security fixes, bug fixes, and clear improvements to the base configuration. That's it.

Everything else (new capabilities, OS compatibility, hardware support, enhancements) should be contributed as skills.

This keeps the base system minimal and lets every user customize their installation without inheriting features they don't want.
